# Yet-Another-Generic-Rougelike-Game
This is another generic rougelike game made in C# and is Cross-platform (possibly MAUI in the future)

## Why make this?
Well I'm stuck in lockdown (as of writing) so I decided to remake some of my old projects,
so this is a remaster of Rarisma/A-Generic-Roguealike-Game

## Cool, what's new?
- Completely New UI 
- Extended modding ability
- Chance of iOS port (Unlikely but Xamarin supports it)
- Completly rewritten in C#
- Most aspects of the game remade
- New spell sytem
- Reworked battle system
- Reverted to file based resources
- Possibilites of graphics

## Estimated release?

I'm hoping to have a working alpha available on Windows 10 (UWP) and android (APK) by the end of Febuary
I do not have a date yet for a possible 1.0 release yet

## Will the be on Microsoft Store/Google Play/F-Droid/ect.
I am still looking into this as I will have the prerequisite files (APPX/APK) but I need to research into submitting and publishing these,
it seems that my main issue is obtaining a certificate.
